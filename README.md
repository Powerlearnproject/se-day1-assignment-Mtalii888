# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software enginnering is all about writing instructions called code to the computer, building apps and solving real world problems.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
adoption of object oriented programming
emergence of igh level language
rise of cloud computing

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning,it involves communicating with relevant paries inquiring what that software might require.
design,it involves designing prototype and diagrams that provide a clear plan for developers.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

a waterfall methodology is a project management approach where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next one. agile methodology emphasizes iterative development, frequent feedback and adaptability to change throughout the cycle
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 the role of a software develpoer is to write the code of the software,a quality assurance engineer is responsible for testing the code ensuring it meets the quality standards while a project manager plans the software development process creating deadlinea allocating roles and resources.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
most IDEs come with debugging tools making it easy for developers to go through their code for example visual studio code,VCS allows a group of developers to work on the same project at the same time without intefering with each others work.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements;requirements of the software may change due to business change or technology shift which disrupts the development cycle of the software,this challenge can be solved through using agile methodology and keeping frequent communication with stakeholders
collaboration and communication;software engineers often work in groups therefore miscommunivatin can lead to misunderstanding or delays,they can overcome this by having frequent meetings and proper documentation to avoid miscommunication

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

unit,it focuses on testing the individual units of the software such as classes,it helps developers be aware of error early enough in the project
integration, it tests different modules in the software work together as excpected, it ensures thst integrated components work correctly with each other
system, involves testing the entire software system as a whole,ensure the components functions well as expected in real world
acceptance,it is performed by the client making sure the software works as expected in real world usage, it ensures that the software aligns with the business requirements
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of refining inputs given to AI models,
accuracy, a well organised prompt makes the ai give accurate response


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
poor prompt;tell me about kenya,
better prompt;who is the president of kenya,how many counties does it have and what is the system of governance.
